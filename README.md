# Operation Hot Wheels 🚗 🔥 

<details> <summary> Briefing Time 🔎 </summary>

## Birmingham's overall crime rate is a whopping 193% of the national average

Vehicle crime isn't just about cars being stolen or damaged. It destroys livelihoods, freedoms and erodes trust not just amongst each other in society, but the public's trust in the police. Because of these criminals, pedestrians and other road drivers are subjected to an increased risk of accidents, exposire to theft, PTSD or even death. Understanding patterns of vehicular crime through detailed data analyses allows us to support law enforcers in restoring order in high-risk areas by understanding previous incidents, predicting future incidents and reccomending best courses of action to lower crime rates. 


I have chosen to focus on Operation Hot wheels for my personal project as it directly relates to my role as an ANPR researcher within the West Midlands Police, and aligns with their goal to decrease vehicle related crimes within Birmingham. Vehicular crime is a significant issue within the West Midlands, and has lasting mental, financial and physical negative impacts for victims of such crimes. With my passion of using data to fight crime, this project gives me the opportunity to analyse patterns in vehicle offenses and explore ways to predict and prevent incidents.

<details> <summary> The Big Question 🙋‍♀️ </summary>

## What patterns in vehicle crime can be used to predict and prevent incidents affecting pedestrians?


Understanding the patterns of vehicular crime is vital as it allows law enforcement to anticipate where and when pedestrians are most at risk. This knowledge not only prevents harm to the public as we would be able to prematurely intercept a criminal before they act, but reduces fear in the community.

## Predictive and Prescriptive analytic models are most relevant here. 

Predictive analyses will help us to identify patterns and conditions likely to result in a vehicle related crime. 


Prescriptive analytic models will advise on how to prevent incidents which may put pedestrians in harm's way.

<details><summary> Which data elements apply? 🤔 </summary>

- Number of vehichle related crimes within the area per month


- Location of the different areas where crimes take place

  
- Time/date means the day, month, or even hour of occurence

  
- Type of crime refers to the category of vehicle crime. I will look at the top three most common for Birmingham which are Theft of Motor Vehicle (TOMV), Theft from Motor Vehicle (TEMV) and criminal damage to a motor vehicle.
