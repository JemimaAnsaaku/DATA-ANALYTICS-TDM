<details><summary> Objectives âœ… </summary>

During this module, I learned how to describe the various sources of data that are used in data analytics. I became able to describe various types of structured and unstructured data files. Finally, I was able to configure data according to the requirements of an analysis.

<details><summary> Selecting relevant data ðŸ”Ž </summary>

Selecting relevant data is vital in ensuring the validity and reliability of data analysis. It may be necessary to establish new procedures to collect the data required or could also involve combining data from multiple sources into a format that can be analysed. 
</details>

<details><summary> What should I ask myself when collecting a data source? </summary>

1. what data points are necessary to inform my analysis?

2. do i already have access to this data or must i find a dataset from another source?

3. Where are reliable and verifiable sources of this data?

4. How relevant is the data collected and updated

5. How is the data licensed for use, and is there a cost

6. Is the data in a format that i can use, or convert to use with the tools i have available?

<details><summary> combining relevant data in excel </summary>

Data analytics involves pulling information from multiple sources, which can be challenging to keep synchronised. In the Lab practical, I used Excel's workbook links feature to connect one worksheet to others, which ensures that data stays up to date. 


External references are espcially useful when large models cannot be stored in a single workbook. This feature allows me to:

- Consolidate data from multiple workbooks (years, departments, products) for summaries, reports or graphs.

- create subsets of data by linking only relevant information instead of entire workbooks.

- split complex data into smaller, more manageable workbooks while still being able to generate summaries or combined reports.

<details><summaries> LAB: Part 1: Link Multiple Worksheets </summaries>


I started off with two seperate worksheet datasets containing data about the bike sales from two seperate years, 2021 and 2022. 


I then opened up a new worksheet that was blank, and renamed it 'BikeSales_Consolidated'. 


Within workbook 'BikeSales_Consolidated' I pressed the '=' in cell A1, selected the tab of the worksheet that I wanted to import, which was Bike_Sales_2021, went back onto BikeSales_Consolidated, the function then contained the url of the worksheet i was importing and i clicked enter. 


I then repeated the process for workbook Bike_sales_2022.

i refreshed workbook links to sync data

workbooks are useful when managing data across multioke files, this comes in handy for tasks such as consolidating departmental budgets, combining regional sales, tracking projects, or splitting large datasets as they keep everything synchronised.
