The Data Analytics Revolution

Data analytics has transformed from a tool used by a few organizations to a widespread approach that drives business decisions. Originally, analytics focused on **descriptive data**, which is historical information such as customer transactions, inventory levels, or defect reports. This data is usually compiled monthly or quarterly and is not analyzed in real time.

Why it mattered:** Descriptive analytics helped businesses understand past performance. Examples include tracking product sales, company profitability, inventory lead times, and advertising success. The key goal was to present clear information to non-technical decision makers. Because the data did not change during analysis, the results were highly reliable.

Today, simply analysing past data is not enough. Organizations must react to **current conditions** and predict future trends. This is made possible by **next-generation analytics**, which leverages real-time data from diverse sources, including documents, social media, e-commerce platforms, sensors, and images.

Examples of advanced analytics in action:**  
- Banks detecting potentially fraudulent transactions as they happen.  
- Manufacturers monitoring defect reports to quickly adjust production.  
- Retailers responding instantly to customer feedback to improve products or sales strategies.

The result is that businesses no longer rely solely on management intuition or past results; they can make **fast, informed, and transformative decisions**. Data analysts and data science professionals are central to this revolution.



Different Types of Analysis

Data analytics is the process of using data to answer questions, uncover trends, and extract meaningful insights. There are four main types, each providing unique perspectives:

- Descriptive Analytics: Answers *“What happened?”*  
  Focuses on summarizing historical data to understand past events and performance.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Answers *“What might happen in the future?”*  
  Uses patterns in historical data to forecast future outcomes and trends.

- Prescriptive Analytics: Answers *“What should be done next?”*  
  Suggests actionable strategies based on predictive insights to optimize results.

- Diagnostic Analytics: Answers *“Why did this happen?”*  
  Investigates causes and relationships in past data to explain results.

Why these types matter:** Each type provides different insights and advantages. Used together, they offer a complete understanding of an organization’s performance, opportunities, and risks.

The Data Analysis Process

Data analysis can follow many different models, but a common approach is the **six-step Data Analysis Lifecycle**. This model is iterative, meaning steps can be repeated to ensure accuracy and confidence before moving forward. The six steps are:

1. Asking the Question**  
   Every analysis begins with a clear question. This could be simple, such as “Which bicycle colour is most popular with younger buyers?” or complex, like “Why are certain cancer cells resistant to radiation treatments?”  
   **Why:** Defining the question guides the entire analysis and ensures the data collected is relevant.

2. Getting the Data**  
   This step involves finding and obtaining data that can answer the question. It also includes checking if there is enough data to conduct a meaningful analysis.  
   Why: Without enough quality data, the analysis may be incomplete or misleading.

3. Investigating the Data**  
   Data can come from many sources and formats. Here, you check if the data is complete, consistent, and relevant to the analysis.  
   **Why:** Understanding the data prevents errors and ensures that results are reliable.

4. **Preparing the Data**  
   This involves transforming raw data into a usable format, often called “cleaning” the data. Tasks include removing blank records, correcting errors, and structuring data for analysis tools.  
   Why: Clean, well-structured data allows for accurate analysis and meaningful results.

5. Analysing the Data
   Analysis identifies patterns, correlations, and relationships in the data. It often involves statistical techniques and tools like spreadsheets, visualisations, or software applications.  
   Why: This is the step where insights are extracted, enabling informed decisions.

6. Presenting the Results
   The final step is sharing findings with decision-makers through reports, charts, or dashboards. Analysts may also provide recommendations based on the results.  
   **Why:** Clear presentation ensures that insights lead to actionable decisions.

Business Understanding

The first step, **Asking the Question**, is closely tied to business understanding. Analysts must align projects with business goals and stakeholder requirements. Every type of organization benefits from understanding its data to improve processes, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.

Example projects and questions:**

- Marketing focus:**  
  A bicycle company wants to improve sales by targeting marketing where it will be most effective. By analysing sales records and customer demographics, analysts can advise where advertising will increase new business.  

- Inventory management:**  
  A medical supply company wants to ensure it stocks the right products. Analysing hospital data on patient demographics and common diagnoses helps predict supply needs.  

- Product recommendations:**  
  Recommendation systems, such as those used by streaming or e-commerce platforms, analyse customer habits, ratings, and purchases to suggest new products or services.  

Why business understanding matters:** Aligning data projects with business goals ensures the analysis is actionable and relevant. 

Beyond business:** Data analysis can also answer personal questions or explore individual interests. Developing skills across the Data Analysis Lifecycle helps build a project portfolio, which is crucial for demonstrating capabilities to potential employers in data analytics.
