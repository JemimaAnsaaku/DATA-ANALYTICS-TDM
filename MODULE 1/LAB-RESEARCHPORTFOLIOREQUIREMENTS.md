# Operation Hot Wheels 🚗 🔥 

<details> <summary> Briefing Time 🔎 (Introduction) </summary>

## Birmingham's overall crime rate is a whopping 193% of the national average

I have chosen to focus on Operation Hot wheels for my personal project as it directly relates to my role as an ANPR researcher within the West Midlands Police, and aligns with their goal to decrease vehicle related crimes within Birmingham. Vehicular crime is a significant issue within the West Midlands, and has lasting mental, financial and physical negative impacts for victims of such crimes. With my passion of using data to fight crime, this project gives me the opportunity to analyse patterns in vehicle offenses and explore ways to predict and prevent incidents.

<details><summary> Business Understanding 🎯  </summary>
Vehicle crime represents a significant operational challenge for the West Midlands Police (WMP), as it directly challenges the commitments they have promised to protect, being to protect human life and property. Vehicle crime impacts public safety, community confidence and the abundance of police resources. Both pedestrians and road users are vulnerable when exposed to the elevated risks of accidents, theft or serious injury. Failiure to prevent and protect the public by the WMP is often met with backlash, a decrease of trust in lawful processes and with each other in society. 


For the WMP, leveraging quantitative date to be used in statistical analyses is critical to support evidence-based-decision-making, which often aids in more accurate geographic and time sensitive hotspots to predict future offences and identify processes which can prevent crime from first taking place.  


By understanding crime patterns, I can reccomend data-driven best practices to reduce crime, improve public safety, and increase efficiency of WMP's resource allocation.

<details> <summary> The Big Question 🙋‍♀️ </summary>

## What patterns in vehicle crime can be used to predict and prevent incidents affecting pedestrians?


Understanding the patterns of vehicular crime is vital as it allows law enforcement to anticipate where and when pedestrians are most at risk. This knowledge not only prevents harm to the public as we would be able to prematurely intercept a criminal before they act, but reduces fear in the community.

<details> <summary> Data Sourcing 📉  </summary>

## Predictive and Prescriptive analytic models are most relevant here. 

Predictive analyses will help us to identify patterns and conditions likely to result in a vehicle related crime. 


Prescriptive analytic models will advise on how to prevent incidents which may put pedestrians in harm's way.

<details><summary> Which data elements apply? 🤔 </summary>

- Number of vehichle related crimes within the area per month


- Location of the different areas where crimes take place

  
- Time/date means the day, month, or even hour of occurence

  
- Type of crime refers to the category of vehicle crime. I will look at the top three most common for Birmingham which are Theft of Motor Vehicle (TOMV), Theft from Motor Vehicle (TEMV) and criminal damage to a motor vehicle.
