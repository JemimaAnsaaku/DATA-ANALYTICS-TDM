# Observations, Variables and values 

<details><summary> Key words and concepts üîê </summary>
    
- Variable: anything that varies from one instant to another, that can be measured and whos value can be manipulated or controlled in theoretical scenarios.

- Observations: recordings of the values, patterns and occurences for a set of variables.

- Data point: the value or set of values for a specific observation.

- Analytics: Use of mathematics, statistics, and computer programming to discover relevant patterns in recorded information.

- value: something that occured in an instance

<details><summary> Types of Variables üìä  </summary>

- Categorical variables - indicates membership in a paticular group and has a discrete or specific qualitative value. They are classified into two types, **nominal or ordinal**

- **nominal** - these are variables that consist of two or more discrete categories whose values is assigned based on the identity of the object. This could be eye vcolour, gender, or type of animal.

- **ordinal** - these are variables that consist of two or more categories in which order matters in the value. Examples are student glass ranking


- **Numerical variables** - fully quantitative values, they may fall either into types **continuous or discrete**

- **continuous** - these are variables that are quantitative and can be measured along a continuum or range of calues. there are two types of continuous variables:
- **interval** - can have any value within the range of values, an example can be temperature or time
- **ratio** - special interval variables where a value of zero can mean that there is none of that variable, examples are income or sales volume.

- **discrete**- these types of continuous variables are quantitative but have a specific value from a finite set of values. Examples include the number of sensors activated in a network or the number of cars in a lot.
