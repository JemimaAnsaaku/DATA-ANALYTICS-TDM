# Transforming data with excel 

<details><summary>Objectives üïµÔ∏è </summary>

Introduction / Reflection


Step four for me was all about getting data ready for analysis. I realised that datasets often have blank rows, wrong formats, or messed-up entries, and if I don‚Äôt fix these, my analysis can go completely wrong. Working through this module, I used Excel to import, clean, and prepare data, which made me understand how important it is to start with clean, organised data before doing anything else.


What I Learned


I learned how to transform data properly in Excel. I practiced sorting and filtering, changing data formats, using conditional formatting, and combining datasets, which helped me see how each step makes the dataset easier to work with. Using formulas and functions taught me how to calculate and transform data efficiently, instead of doing it all manually. Finally, working with pivot tables showed me how I can summarise, explore, and present data clearly, which gave me a better idea of how to spot trends and patterns in a dataset.
Overall, this module taught me that preparing and cleaning data isn‚Äôt just boring busy work ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential for accurate analysis, and learning these Excel skills has made me feel much more confident handling real-world datasets.

Objectives / Reflection


In this lab, I learnt the basics of sorting and filtering data in Excel. I used a sample dataset to practise organising and exploring data, which helped me see how much easier it is to analyse data when it‚Äôs structured properly.


Part 1: Download and Prepare a Sample Data Set


I opened the Bike Sales CSV file in Excel and adjusted the column widths so I could see everything properly. I also froze the top row so the headings stayed visible while I scrolled down. Doing this made me realise how small presentation changes can make large datasets much easier to work with and read.


Part 2: Sort the Data


Next, I learnt how to sort data. I selected all the data and used Custom Sort to organise it by Country and then by Sub-category in ascending order. This showed me how quickly Excel can group information and make patterns obvious. I also learned how to clear sorting and filters when I wanted to start fresh.


Part 3: Filter the Data


Then, I converted the data into a table and applied filters. Using the drop-down arrows, I could show only specific groups, like Young Adults in the Age_Group column. I realised that filtering doesn‚Äôt move the data‚Äîit just hides rows temporarily, which is really useful for focusing on the information I need.


Reflection / What I Learned


Sorting and filtering taught me how to make sense of large datasets without changing the original data. I could answer questions like how many Senior customers there were in December, which days in Germany had the highest profit, and which US state made the most sales. Overall, this lab helped me understand that cleaning, sorting, and filtering data are essential first steps before any analysis, and it made me feel more confident using Excel to explore and present data.
