## Hi, my name's Jemima. 
  
This portfolio marks the start of my Data Analytics journey with The West Midlands Police (WMP) and The Development Manager (TDM). Please join me throughout my learning process as I begin to understand more about why businesses use data analyses for countless reasons, and how this is vital to decision making as a whole. I will begin with simple personal projects as a form of practical learning and update my portfolio with more complex projects as time moves on. Each project will aim to reflect real world business practices.

  # Operation Hot wheels 🚗🔥

  I have chosen to focus on Operation Hot wheels for my personal project as it directly relates to my role as an ANPR researcher within the West Midlands Police, and aligns with their goal to decrease vehicle related crimes within Birmingham. Vehicular crime is a significant issue within the West Midlands, and has lasting mental, financial and physical negative impacts for victims of such crimes. With my passion of using data to fight crime, this project gives me the opportunity to analyse patterns in vehicle offenses and explore ways to predict and prevent incidents. 


I will do this by concentration on three of the most serious and common types of vehicular crimes within Birmingham, which are **Theft of Motor Vehicles (TOMV), Theft from Motor Vehicles (TEMV) and criminal damage**
