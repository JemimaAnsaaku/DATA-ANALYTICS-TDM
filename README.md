  <summary> First on the Scene 🚓 </summary>
Hi, I am Jemima. 
  
This portfolio marks the start of my Data Analytics journey with The West Midlands Police (WMP) and The Development Manager (TDM). Please join me throughout my learning process as I begin to understand more about why businesses use data analyses for countless reasons, and how this is vital to decision making as a whole. I will begin with simple personal projects as a form of practical learning and update my portfolio with more complex projects as time moves on. Each project will aim to reflect real world business practices.
