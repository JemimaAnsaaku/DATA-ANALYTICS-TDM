# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository documents my journey through the TDM Data Analytics Level 4 course, including labs, projects, and reflections on the skills I have developed and applied. It also links my academic and professional experiences to my growth as a data analyst.

## About Me

I began my academic journey studying for a BSc in Psychology, developing a strong understanding of human behaviour. Early in my career, I joined TSB as an anti-fraud advisor. This role sparked my interest in enforcing policies and protecting others, combining analytical skills with a focus on security and prevention.  

Realising I wanted to build on my psychology knowledge in a more applied and investigative way, I pursued a Master's in Forensic Psychology. Once I graduated, I took the opportunity to join the West Midlands Police, where their values and commitment to serving the public aligned with my own.  

The apprenticeship with TDM, in collaboration with the Level 4 Data Analytics provider, has given me the chance to formalise and expand my analytical skills while applying them to real-world policing and security challenges.

## My Data Analytics Journey

My journey connects psychology, fraud prevention, and policing:

- Understanding human behaviour through psychology underpins my analytical reasoning.  
- Experience in anti-fraud taught me the importance of protecting people by enforcing policies.  
- Forensic psychology expanded my understanding of investigative processes and critical thinking.  
- Working with the West Midlands Police allows me to apply data analysis in real operational contexts to support law enforcement and public safety.  
- The TDM Level 4 Data Analytics course provides formal training to enhance my ability to analyse, interpret, and communicate data effectively.  

This portfolio reflects both my practical experience and the analytical skills I have developed through structured learning and applied projects.
