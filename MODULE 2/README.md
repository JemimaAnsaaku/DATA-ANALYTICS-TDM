# - EXCEL BASICS 

<details><summary> Objective üåü  </summary> 
  
During this module I learned about the basic building blocks of knowledge that will aid me in utilising excel to the greatest efficiency. In this time I utilised TDM's resources to learn about the different functions and entities in excel as well as their uses. This will make using excel quicker and easier and helps break down the steps in order to understand the purpose.

<details><summary> Data Key words üîë </summary>

- Dataset- collection of data

- CSV - A common format used to package, exchange, inport and export data.

- Excel - A powerful tool used for small datasets and quick data analysis. We may use it to manipulate and summarise data, as well as summarising it with pivot tables.

- SQL - Structured Query Language - A powerful database tool that allows data analysts to retrieve and interact with selections of fata within relational databases.

- Relationsal Databases - Relational databases have a defined structure and contain multiple interrelated data tables that need to be queried with a language like SQL to be useful. 

- Tableau - data analytics and visualisation tool that can combine and extract data from multiple different sources (like excel spreadsheets and SQL databases.)

<details><summary> Using excel üìù </summary>

- Column - letters at the top of the spreadsheet going across

- row - numbers to the left of the spreadsheet going down

- cell - any rectangular box within the intersection of the column and row

- cell name box - placed above column A- may enter the coordinates of one or more cells to select and activate the cells

- cell reference - column letter followed by row number

- values - numbers or letters typed into the cells - may contain mathematical equations or functions performing equations

- formula bar - long white bar next to the f x symbol where you can enter functions, data, formulas, cell references and text concatenation

<details><summary> Excel shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è </summary>

- arrow keys - move up, down, left and right

- ctrl + arrow keys - jump to the edge of the data region

- ctrl + home - go to cell A1

- ctrl + end - go to the last cell with data

- F2 - edit active cell

- ctrl + c - copy

- ctrl + v - paste

- ctrl + x - cut

- delete - clear cell contents

- ctrl + z - undo

- ctrl + y - redo

- ctrl + b - bold

- ctrl + i - italic

- ctrl + u - underline

- ctrl + 1 - open format cells dialogue

<details><summary> Excel Function Library üìö </summary>

- Sum - Adds numeric data in the referenced cells. example:  =SUM(A1:D5)

- Average - Automatically assumes you want to find the average of all values in the cells above and inputs the matching formula in the active cell. example: =AVERAGE(B3:K3)

- Count - Counts number of CELLS (not values within those cells). example: =COUNT(B8:M8)

- Min - will find the lowest VALUE within the referenced cells. example: =MIN(A3:C3)

- Max - finds the highest VALUE within the referenced cells. example: =MAX(A1:H1)

- Median - finds the median VALUE within the referenced cells. example =MEDIAN(A2:A43)

<details><summary> Numbers üíØ </summary>

in this section you can control how excel treats or displays the values within the call. There are multiple common uses:


- general - Default, excel decides if its a number, text or date

- number - normal numbers with decimals, here we can choose the number of decimal spaces

- currency - displays as money

- accounting - similar to currency, but aligns the currency symbol neatly

- date - formats number as a date

- time - formats number as a time

- percentage - multiplies the value by 100 then shows the percentage symbol (%)

- fraction - displays numbers as fractions

- scientific - shows numbers in an exponential notation

- text - treats whatever you type as text, even if it is a number

# Observations, Variables and values

<details><summary> Key words and concepts üîê </summary>
    
- Variable: anything that varies from one instant to another, that can be measured and whos value can be manipulated or controlled in theoretical scenarios.

- Observations: recordings of the values, patterns and occurences for a set of variables.

- Data point: the value or set of values for a specific observation.

- Analytics: Use of mathematics, statistics, and computer programming to discover relevant patterns in recorded information.

- value: something that occured in an instance

<details><summary> Types of Variables üìä  </summary>

- Categorical variables - indicates membership in a paticular group and has a discrete or specific qualitative value. They are classified into two types, **nominal or ordinal**

- **nominal** - these are variables that consist of two or more discrete categories whose values is assigned based on the identity of the object. This could be eye vcolour, gender, or type of animal.

- **ordinal** - these are variables that consist of two or more categories in which order matters in the value. Examples are student glass ranking


- **Numerical variables** - fully quantitative values, they may fall either into types **continuous or discrete**

- **continuous** - these are variables that are quantitative and can be measured along a continuum or range of calues. there are two types of continuous variables:
- **interval** - can have any value within the range of values, an example can be temperature or time
- **ratio** - special interval variables where a value of zero can mean that there is none of that variable, examples are income or sales volume.

- **discrete**- these types of continuous variables are quantitative but have a specific value from a finite set of values. Examples include the number of sensors activated in a network or the number of cars in a lot.
